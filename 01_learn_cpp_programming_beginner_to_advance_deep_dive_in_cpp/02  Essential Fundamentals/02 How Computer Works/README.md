# Learn C++ Programming -Beginner to Advance- Deep Dive in C++

## 02  Essential Fundamentals

### 02 how Computer Works

- CPU [ Heart of computer ]
  - ALU [Arithmetic and logical]
  - CU [Control Unit] - Control other devices
- Input Device
- Output Device
- Main Memory
- Hard Disk
  - Files
  - program File
  - Data File [ Audio / Video]
  - Run any program run under main memory but accessed from Hard Disk Files
  - CPU executes the program line by line
  - Program inputs fro input device
  - Program outputs output device
  - Input Buffer & Output Buffer

### Number System

- Low voltage taken as 0 & high voltage taken as 1
- Chip have pins
  - Through the pins pass low/high voltage
  - 8 bits
  - 00000000
  - 00000001
  - 0 & 1 's are instructions
  - Based on binary System
  - Each line by instructions
